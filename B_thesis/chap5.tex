In this thesis, we proposed a novel RL-based method for the synthesis of a controller for an LTL specification using a limit-deterministic generalized B\"{u}chi automaton.
The proposed method improved the learning performance compared to existing methods and we showed that the proposed method synthesizes a control policy satisfying a given LTL formula with nonzero probability.
Then, we proposed a novel RL-based method with an augmented tLDGBA that synthesizes a supervisor satisfying (i) a given LTL formula with nonzero probability and (ii) safety constraints with probability 1.  We evaluated the proposed method with an example of the maze of a cat and a mouse.
The following arguments are future works. (i) We investigate the method synthesizing a controller that maximizes the satisfaction probability. (ii) We expand our proposed method to a hierarchical control. (iii) We apply our proposed method to multiagent systems.
